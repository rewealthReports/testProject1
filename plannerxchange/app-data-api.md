# PlannerXchange App Data API

This document defines the builder-facing write contract for PlannerXchange-hosted app-owned work product.

It is separate from the canonical-data read contract. Builder apps read canonical reference facts and write builder-owned work product through different API families.

## Core rule

Immutable or reference facts (accounts, positions, transactions, tax lots) are read-only through canonical data routes. Builder-owned work product (recommendations, scenario runs, questionnaire responses, projections, notes) is written through the app-data API.

## Availability

- Explorer-tier builders should assume no PlannerXchange-hosted app-data persistence
- Externally hosted showcase apps should use their own persistence
- Shell-published apps on paid tiers may use this contract when the tier entitles PlannerXchange-hosted persistence

## Permission scopes

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `app_data.read` | Read app-data records for the current app and firm |
| `app_data.write` | Create and update app-data records for the current app and firm |

These are separate from canonical data scopes.

## Record envelope

Every app-data record has this shape:

```json
{
  "recordId": "appdata_123",
  "recordType": "recommendation_set",
  "title": "2026 rebalance proposal",
  "status": "draft",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "appId": "app_rebalancer",
  "appInstallationId": "install_123",
  "firmId": "firm_123",
  "clientUserId": "client_456",
  "householdId": null,
  "accountId": null,
  "sourceRefs": [
    {
      "sourceType": "canonical_account",
      "sourceId": "acct_123",
      "asOf": "2026-03-19T15:04:05Z"
    },
    {
      "sourceType": "integration_exposed",
      "sourceSystem": "altruist",
      "sourceId": "portfolio_789",
      "asOf": "2026-03-19T15:04:05Z"
    }
  ],
  "payload": {
    "summary": "Shift 8% from large-cap growth to short-duration treasuries.",
    "recommendations": []
  },
  "createdAt": "2026-03-19T15:04:05Z",
  "updatedAt": "2026-03-19T15:04:05Z",
  "createdByUserId": "user_123",
  "updatedByUserId": "user_123"
}
```

## Source references

The `sourceRefs` array tracks which data inputs were used to produce this work product. This enables provenance tracking, export, and future promotion to canonical data.

Allowed source categories:

| Category | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `canonical_*` | PlannerXchange canonical inputs (e.g. `canonical_account`, `canonical_position`) |
| `integration_exposed` | Partner-hosted inputs surfaced through PlannerXchange integrations |
| `app_owned_upload` | App-owned files or uploads |
| `manual_entry` | User-entered data |

Each source ref should include:

- `sourceType` — category identifier
- `sourceId` — the entity ID or resource key
- `sourceSystem` — (for `integration_exposed`) the integration partner name
- `asOf` — ISO timestamp of the data snapshot used

## Recommended record types

| Record type | Example use |
|-------------|-------------|
| `scenario_run` | Modeled portfolio scenario with parameters and results |
| `recommendation_set` | Rebalancing recommendations or action items |
| `questionnaire_response` | Client onboarding questionnaire answers |
| `projection_run` | Cashflow projections, retirement simulations |
| `note` | App-authored text snippets, summaries, annotations |

## Recommended status values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Work in progress, not yet shared or finalized |
| `final` | Completed and ready for review or sharing |
| `archived` | Soft-deleted or historical |

## Routes

Current route status:

| Route | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /app-data` | live | builder-owned work-product listing |
| `POST /app-data` | live | builder-owned work-product create |
| `GET /app-data/{recordId}` | live | single-record read |
| `PATCH /app-data/{recordId}` | live | single-record update |
| `DELETE /app-data/{recordId}` | not yet live | do not assume availability until PlannerXchange exposes it |

### `GET /app-data`

List builder-owned work-product records for the current app and firm.

**Required scope:** `app_data.read`

**Query parameters:** `recordType`, `clientUserId`, `householdId`, `accountId`, `status`, `limit`, `cursor`

**Response:**

```json
{
  "items": [
    { "recordId": "appdata_123", "recordType": "recommendation_set", "..." : "..." }
  ],
  "pageInfo": { "limit": 25, "nextCursor": "cursor_123" }
}
```

### `POST /app-data`

Create a new work-product record.

**Required scope:** `app_data.write`

**Request body:**

```json
{
  "recordType": "recommendation_set",
  "title": "2026 rebalance proposal",
  "status": "draft",
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "clientUserId": "client_456",
  "sourceRefs": [
    {
      "sourceType": "canonical_account",
      "sourceId": "acct_123",
      "asOf": "2026-03-19T15:04:05Z"
    }
  ],
  "payload": {
    "summary": "Shift 8% from large-cap growth to short-duration treasuries."
  }
}
```

**Response:** the created record with server-assigned `recordId`, `appId`, `appInstallationId`, `firmId`, `createdAt`, `createdByUserId`.

### `GET /app-data/{recordId}`

Fetch one record.

**Required scope:** `app_data.read`

**Response:** single record envelope.

### `PATCH /app-data/{recordId}`

Update mutable fields on an existing record.

**Required scope:** `app_data.write`

**Request body (partial update):**

```json
{
  "status": "final",
  "payload": {
    "summary": "Approved rebalance recommendation."
  }
}
```

**Response:** the updated record.

### `DELETE /app-data/{recordId}`

Not live today for builder apps.

Do not build new app code that depends on delete support unless PlannerXchange explicitly activates this route.

## Record ownership and boundaries

Every record is anchored to:

- `appId` — the app that created it
- `appInstallationId` — the specific installation
- `firmId` — the firm boundary

Optional attachment targets:

- `clientUserId`
- `householdId`
- `accountId`

Boundary rules:

- `firmId` is the maximum data boundary
- Apps may impose stricter intra-firm scoping — prefer configurable over hardcoded
- Apps should not assume cross-firm visibility

## Mutation rules

Builder apps **may**:

- Create new work-product records
- Update record payloads and status
- Attach work product to the current app, firm, and optional client or account context

Builder apps **may not**:

- Overwrite immutable canonical reference facts through this contract
- Treat partner-owned reference data as app-owned mutable data
- Claim that app-data records are cross-app portable by default

## Portability rule

PlannerXchange-hosted app-data records are governed and exportable but are not canonical or cross-app portable by default. If PlannerXchange later promotes a record family to canonical data, that happens through an explicit contract change.

## Review implications

Apps using app-data writes should expect publication review for:

- Scope minimization — does the app request more write access than it needs?
- Firm-boundary compliance — does data stay within the correct `firmId`?
- Source-reference integrity — are `sourceRefs` populated for traceability?
- Sensitive-data handling — is client PII stored appropriately?
- Auditability — can the record trail be reconstructed?

Day 1 rule: external AI-provider or third-party egress of PX client data is not allowed.
